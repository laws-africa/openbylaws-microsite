        <p class="lead">
          Municipal by-laws form part of the legal foundation for effective
          service delivery and cooperative communities. In many municipalities,
          however, the by-laws are out of date or difficult to find. Open By-laws
          helps to solve this problem by working with a contributor community to
          put up-to-date by-laws online, freely available to everyone.
        </p>

        <h3>What are by-laws?</h3>
        <p>
          By-laws are laws managed by municipalities. <a href="https://myconstitution.co.za/en/07.html#powers-and-functions-of-municipalities">The Constitution of South Africa</a> gives municipalities the power to pass their own legislation, in the form of by-laws, for particular subject areas. These by-laws the same power and force as other national and provincial legislation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Municipalities are required by the Municipal Systems Act to make their by-laws publicly available on their website. However, most municipalities lack the capacity to do so. Open By-laws helps to fill this gap.
        </p>

        <h3>Powered by Laws.Africa</h3>
        <p>
          Open By-laws is a project of <a href="https://laws.africa">Laws.Africa</a>, a non-profit organisation that curates the African legislation commons and builds technology to enable free access to the law.
        </p>

        <p>
        Laws.Africa trains and supports a contributor community that is working together to build an African legislation commons and make African law freely available to everyone.
        </p>

        <h3>How you can help</h3>

        <p>
          The by-laws on this website are maintained by a community of contributors. The contributors work hard to put by-laws online and keep them up-to-date. Laws.Africa provides training and support and builds the technology that makes this project possible.
